JS App Idea - Book Finder	

Creating a CRUD based app in JavaScript that allows me to log all my books, give them a star rating as I read them and search for them to find their location in the house.

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

Create

Create a book with the following properties:

- title
- author
- genre
- location
- rating (default set to ‘not read’)

Read 

Search for a book using these properties and receive back all properties including location and rating:

- title
- author
- genre

Update

Access any book and update the rating and location property

Delete

Access any book and delete it.

Ideas that I haven't got a clue how to do right now:

- Search for books that fit two or more criteria at once e.g all books of x genre with a rating of x+.

- Take photo of book title/barcode to load into my library, confirm selected book is correct with prompt and then ask user for location information and a user star rating.

- Pull book data from Amazon/Good Reads and then search for books in my library with a rating of x on Amazon/Good Reads.

- Add top rated review from Amazon/Good Reads as a text field for each book.

- Add text input for user review as well as user rating.
